## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series forecasting (TSF) has garnered significant attention among researchers. This study presents a novel LLM-based framework, **CGF-LLM**, which combines **GPT-2**, **fuzzy time series (FTS)** techniques, and **causal graphs** to predict multivariate time series. 

The approach introduces a parallel process of **fuzzification** and **causal discovery**, converting raw numerical series into a **structured and interpretable textual format**. This enriched input is then used to fine-tune a pretrained GPT-2 model. The resulting architecture enhances both the **semantic understanding** and **structural representation** of time series dynamics.

Our experiments, conducted on four diverse multivariate time series datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed method.
